                Welcome to <strong>Indevs.in</strong> (“we”, “our”, “us”, or “Indevs”). We are a student-operated, non-commercial platform that provides free subdomain hosting under the .indevs.in namespace for developers, students, and independent creators. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use our services. By using Indevs.in, you agree to the practices described below. If you do not agree with this policy, please discontinue use of the platform.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Purpose and Commitment</h3>
            <p>
                At Indevs.in, we believe privacy is a fundamental right. We collect only the minimal data required to operate the service, maintain platform stability, and ensure security. We never sell, rent, or commercially exploit user data under any circumstance. Our mission is to provide a free, open, and reliable subdomain service that respects user privacy and transparency.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>
                When you interact with Indevs.in or request a subdomain, we may collect certain types of information to process your request and maintain service functionality. This includes both data that you voluntarily provide and data automatically collected by our systems.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Information You Provide</strong></p>
            <p>
                When submitting a subdomain request or creating an account, you may be asked to provide your name, email address, chosen subdomain, and optional project details or descriptions. This information helps us assign subdomains responsibly, communicate with you about your domain, and ensure that each registration aligns with our Acceptable Use Policy.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Automatically Collected Information</strong></p>
            <p>
                Our servers automatically record certain technical data when you interact with the website or DNS infrastructure. This may include your IP address, browser type, user-agent, referrer URL, and timestamps of requests. DNS queries may also be temporarily logged for diagnostic and abuse-prevention purposes. These logs are stored for a limited duration and are automatically purged once no longer required.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Cookies and Local Storage</strong></p>
            <p>
                Indevs.in does not use advertising or tracking cookies. We may use a minimal number of essential cookies or browser storage entries strictly for session persistence, login functionality, or user preferences. We do not engage in behavioral tracking or third-party analytics.
            </p>

            <h3>3. How We Use Information</h3>
            <p>
                The information we collect is used solely for operational and security purposes. Specifically, we use it to process subdomain requests, maintain DNS and system functionality, communicate with users about their accounts, and detect or mitigate malicious activity such as spam or phishing attempts. Usage data may also help us monitor server performance, analyze traffic patterns, and improve the overall reliability of the service. We do not use personal data for advertising, profiling, or commercial purposes.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Data Storage and Security</h3>
            <p>
                We take data protection seriously. All user information and platform operations are hosted on enterprise-grade infrastructure, including Oracle Cloud and DigitalOcean. These providers maintain high physical and network security standards, with redundant data centers and strict access controls. Within our systems, we employ encryption, limited-access permissions, and continuous monitoring to safeguard information from unauthorized access or loss.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we rely on secure and well-maintained hosting providers, no online platform can guarantee complete protection against every possible threat. By using Indevs.in, you acknowledge that we employ reasonable and industry-standard measures to protect your data while recognizing that absolute security cannot be guaranteed.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Data Retention</h3>
            <p>
                We retain user data only for as long as necessary to operate the service or comply with legal obligations. Subdomain-related records and contact details are kept while the subdomain remains active. Technical logs, including DNS and access records, are automatically deleted within approximately 30 days. Once a subdomain is deleted, inactive, or revoked, associated data may be permanently erased without recovery options. Deleted data cannot be restored.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
            <p>
                We do not sell, rent, or disclose personal information to advertisers or unrelated third parties. However, limited information may be shared under specific and lawful circumstances — for example, when required by legal obligations, to investigate abuse, or to maintain technical operations through trusted service providers. These providers (such as email relays or DNS infrastructure partners) are bound by confidentiality and security agreements. Any data disclosure is minimal, purpose-driven, and handled securely.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Abuse Handling and Enforcement</h3>
            <p>
                To maintain the integrity of the platform, we reserve the right to review subdomains or associated data in response to verified abuse reports or suspected policy violations. If misuse or illegal activity is confirmed, Indevs.in may suspend, restrict, or permanently remove the subdomain and related data without prior notice. We strive to act responsibly and proportionately in all enforcement actions.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to report abuse, phishing, or malicious activity, please contact us at <a href="mailto:reportabuse@admin.indevs.in" className="text-[#FF6B35] hover:underline">reportabuse@admin.indevs.in</a> with sufficient details for verification.
            </p>

            <h3>8. Your Rights</h3>
            <p>
                Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to request access to your personal data, request correction or deletion, or withdraw consent for processing.

            <p>
                We do not discriminate against users who exercise their privacy rights.
            </p>

            <h3>9. Children’s Privacy</h3>
            <p>
                Indevs.in is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors. If we discover that a child has submitted personal information, we will delete it promptly and revoke any associated subdomain.
            </p>

            <h3>10. Global Hosting and Data Transfers</h3>
            <p>
                Our platform infrastructure may involve servers located in different countries, including India and other regions where our cloud providers operate. By using Indevs.in, you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your information in these regions solely for service operation and maintenance.
            </p>

            <h3>11. Changes to This Policy</h3>
            <p>
                We may modify or update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect operational changes or legal requirements. When updates occur, the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page will change. Significant updates may be announced on our website or via email. Continued use of the Service after any modification constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
            </p>
